This is a Nuxt 3 project with Tailwind CSS pre-configured via @nuxtjs/tailwindcss module.

STYLING:
- Tailwind CSS is already installed and configured — utility classes work immediately
- Use Tailwind utility classes in <template> blocks (e.g., class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg")
- Do NOT use <style scoped> for layout/spacing — always use Tailwind classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design: sm:, md:, lg: breakpoints

COMMANDS — you have full shell access and MUST use it:
- Run `npm install && npm run dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
- Use Composition API with <script setup lang="ts">
- NEVER use `nuxt dev` directly — always use `npm run dev`
- You CAN and SHOULD run any shell commands needed (npm install, npm run dev, etc.)
